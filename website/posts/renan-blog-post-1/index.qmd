For this class setup a website to present the project



## Introduction

Make some cheesy introduction


## How to setup RENV

What is **renv** ?? well, it is an R package that provides powerful dependency management for your projects, ensuring they are isolated, portable, and reproducible.


```{{bash}}
renv::init()
```

## How to setup UV

UV is an extremely fast, next-generation Python package installer and resolver built in Rust by Astral, by consolidating environment creation, package installation, and dependency locking into a single, blazing-fast command-line tool, UV drastically simplifies and accelerates Python development workflows, saving developers significant time and frustration.

```{{bash}}
uv add requests
uv remove requests
uv lock --upgrade-package requests
uv venv
uv sync
```

Activating a VENV

```{{bash}}
source .venv/bin/activate
```

You can add dependencies to your pyproject.toml with the uv add command. This will also update the lockfile and project environment:

```{{bash}}
uv add requests
```

To remove a package, you can use uv remove:

```{{bash}}
uv remove requests
```

To upgrade a package, run uv lock with the --upgrade-package flag:

```{{bash}}
uv lock --upgrade-package requests
```

Creating a virtual environment

```{{bash}}
uv venv
```

Syncing the environment

```{{bash}}
uv sync
```

## Getting Started with Quarto

Install the dependencies


## How to Render and Preview your project

Either use the IDE of your preference, VSCode has extensions to support

or run on the cmd:

To render the quarto document run:

```{{bash}}
quarto render
```

To preview the rendered quarto document run: 

```{{bash}}
quarto preview
```

## How to make Citations

BibTex is a great why to generate consistent and properly formatted Citations, to generate bibtex citations u can use GoogleScholar:

Example: Add here some content explaining how to use GoogleScholar for citations

Add another example using citation generator


1. Create your BibTeX file (e.g., references.bib) and add your entries.

Example:

```{{text}}
@inproceedings{Liu_2021,
   title={Priority prediction of Asian Hornet sighting report using machine learning methods},
   url={http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/SEAI52285.2021.9477549},
   DOI={10.1109/seai52285.2021.9477549},
   booktitle={2021 IEEE International Conference on Software Engineering and Artificial Intelligence (SEAI)},
   publisher={IEEE},
   author={Liu, Yixin and Guo, Jiaxin and Dong, Jieyang and Jiang, Luoqian and Ouyang, Haoyuan},
   year={2021},
   month=jun, pages={7–11} }
```

2. Link the file in your Quarto YAML header (the part at the very top):

```{{yml}}
---
title: "My Document"
bibliography: references.bib
---
```

3. Cite in your text using the BibTeX key: [@key] (e.g., [@Liu_2021]).

Example:

```{{text}}
[Priority prediction of Asian Hornet sighting report using machine learning methods](https://huggingface.co/papers/2107.05465). @Liu_2021
```

[Priority prediction of Asian Hornet sighting report using machine learning methods](https://huggingface.co/papers/2107.05465). @Liu_2021


4. Add a "References" section at the end of your document where the bibliography will be printed.

Example:

```{{text}}
### References

::: {#refs}
:::
```


### References

::: {#refs}
:::
